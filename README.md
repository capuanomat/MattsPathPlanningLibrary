# MattsPathPlanningLibrary
A functional library containing generic implementations of many common, and some less well known planning algorithms.

Note that this library is subject to much restructuring as it is expanded on. This will probably come in addition to a MotionPlanningLibrary, and perhaps a MappingLibrary.

### Algorithms
- Rapidly Exploring Dense Trees: RRT
- A* & Variants
- D*
- Probabilistic roadmaps
