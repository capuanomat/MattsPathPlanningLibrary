    "This document provides a python implementations of Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, UCS, and Dijkstra's along with some visualizations, tests, and analysis. It was written for testing and learning purposes. Though the python implementation of the algorithm below is correct, you should also primarily use it for learning purposes only. The Java implementation in the parent `javaImplementation` directory is more efficient by virtue of the inherrant properties of the languages, and is what you should use if you're using the path planning library for any intensive search problems.\n",

    "<b>Note</b>: You might notice that I implement a lot of the functionality in a very object-oriented manner, I do this to make the eventual migration of this logic to Java easier."
