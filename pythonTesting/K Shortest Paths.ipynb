    "The idea of the algorithm below is to find the k shortest paths to go from one node to another. I.e. if there are n paths of length l from vertex v1 to vertex v2, then it should return all n of them, if the n+1th shortest path has length >l, then that one shouldn't be returned. Or you could specify k, I haven't yet decided.\n",
